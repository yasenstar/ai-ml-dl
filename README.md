| Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AI simulates human intelligence to perform tasks and make decisions. | ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data. | DL is a subset of ML that employs artificial neural networks for complex tasks. |
| AI may or may not require large datasets; it can use predefined rules. | ML heavily relies on labeled data for training and making predictions. | DL requires extensive labeled data and performs exceptionally with big datasets. |
| AI can be rule-based, requiring human programming and intervention. | ML automates learning from data and requires less manual intervention. | DL automates feature extraction, reducing the need for manual enginnering. |
| AI can handel various tasks, from simple to complex, across domains. | ML specializes in data-driven tasks like classification, regression, etc. | DL excels at complext tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more. |
| AI algorithms can be simple or complex, depending on the application. | ML employes various algorithms like decision trees, SVM, and random forests. | DL relies on deep neural networks, which can have numerous hidden layers for complex learning. |
| AI may require less training time and resources for rule-based systems. | ML training time varies with the algorithm complexity and dataset size. | DL training demands substantial computational resources and time for deep networks. |
| AI systems may offer interpretable results based on human rules. | ML models can be interpretable or less interpretable baesd on the algorithm. | DL models are often considered less interpretable due to complex network architectures. |
| AI is used in virtual assitants, recommendation systems, and more. | ML is applied in image recognition, spam filtering, and other data tasks. | DL is utilized in autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, and advanced AI applications. |
