## 📊 High-Level Comparison: AI vs ML vs DL

Understanding the nuances between these fields is critical for applying the right technology to the right problem.

| Feature | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Concept** | AI simulates human intelligence to perform tasks and make decisions. | ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data. | DL is a subset of ML that employs artificial neural networks for complex tasks. |
| **Data Requirements** | May or may not require large datasets; it can use predefined rules. | Heavily relies on labeled data for training and making predictions. | Requires extensive labeled data and performs exceptionally with big datasets. |
| **Human Intervention** | Can be rule-based, requiring human programming and intervention. | Automates learning from data and requires less manual intervention. | Automates feature extraction, reducing the need for manual engineering. |
| **Scope** | Can handle various tasks, from simple to complex, across domains. | Specializes in data-driven tasks like classification, regression, etc. | Excels at complex tasks like image recognition and NLP. |
| **Complexity** | Algorithms can be simple or complex, depending on the application. | Employs various algorithms like decision trees, SVM, and random forests. | Relies on deep neural networks with numerous hidden layers. |
| **Resources** | May require less training time/resources for rule-based systems. | Training time varies with algorithm complexity and dataset size. | Demands substantial computational resources (GPUs) and time. |
| **Interpretability** | Often offers interpretable results based on human rules. | Models can be interpretable or less interpretable based on the algorithm. | Often considered "black boxes" due to complex architectures. |
| **Applications** | Virtual assistants, recommendation systems, expert systems. | Image recognition, spam filtering, predictive analytics. | Autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, advanced AI research. |
