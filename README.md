### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- AI simulates human intelligence to perform tasks and make decisions.
- AI may or may not require large datasets; it can use predefined rules.
- AI can be rule-based, requiring human programming and intervention.
- AI can handel various tasks, from simple to complex, across domains.
- AI algorithms can be simple or complex, depending on the application.
- AI may require less training time and resources for rule-based systems.
- AI systems may offer interpretable results based on human rules.
- AI is used in virtual assitants, recommendation systems, and more.

### Machine Learning (ML)

- ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data.
- ML heavily relies on labeled data for training and making predictions.
- ML automates learning from data and requires less manual intervention.
- ML speci
