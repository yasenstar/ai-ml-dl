## 1.1 Module 1: What is AI?

### About this Module

#### Three levels of predictions that AI can make

##### Narrow

##### Broad

##### General

### What is AI?
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine tolearn patterns andmake predictions.


#### AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI add values to human judgment.
 
AI is a field that combinescomputer science  and robustdataset to enable problem-solving.


### What is the difference between AI and Augmented Intelligence?

#### Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do.

##### Augmented intelligence allows humans to make final decisions after analyzing data, reports, and other types of data

##### Augmented intelligence acts on behalf of people in the physical world in a way that complements human abilities

#### Artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.

##### AI performs tasks without human intervention and completes mundane and repetitive tasks for humans

#### AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

#### Machines vs. Humans

##### Machines

###### Ingesting Large Amount of Data

###### Repetitive Tasks

###### Accurate

##### Humans

###### Generalizing Information

###### Creativity

###### Emotional Intelligence

### What does AI do?

#### Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them "AI Services") don't think. They calculate.

##### They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history.
 
Some can perform what's calledmachine learning  as they acquire new data.

 
Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even performdeep learning  with multiple levels of calculations.


#### Two parts of AI Services Calculate

##### Analysis

###### AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.

##### Prediction

###### AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”
 
AI Services based on dataanalysis, makeprediction.


### What Predictions can AI Make?

#### Prediction aren't always accurate. But if they're correct often enough, they're useful and can save your time.

#### More ways that AI uses data to make predictions

##### Human Language

###### Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.

##### Vision Recognition

###### AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.

##### Fraud Detection

###### AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.

### How is AI Evolving?

#### Narrow AI (2010-2015)

##### Narrow AI si focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day

##### Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. e.g., you can buy a book with a voice-based device.

##### Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.

#### Broad AI (AI for Enterprise) (Today), We are here

##### Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and Genaral AI

##### Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks

##### Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system

##### New Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends

#### General AI (2050 and beyond)

##### General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can

##### Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.

#### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) (near the end of this century)

##### Machine might become self-aware!

## 1.2 Module 2: What are the three eras of computing?

### About this Module

#### Describe the history of AI, from the past to the possible future

### The Era of Tabulation: People have analyzed data for centuries

#### Dark Data

##### Dark Data: it's information without structure, just a huge, unsorted mess of facts.

#### Unstructured Data

##### Over 2000 years ago, tax collectors for Emperor Qin Shihuang used the abacus—a device with beads on wires—to break down tax receipts and arrange them into categories. From this, they could determine how much the Emperor should spend on building extensions to the Great Wall of China.

##### In England during the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace designed (but never finished) what they called a “difference engine” designed to handle complex calculations using logarithms and trigonometry. Had they built it, the difference engine might have helped the English Navy build tables of ocean tides and depth soundings that could guide English sailors through rough waters.

##### By the late 1880s, people were thinking about how to develop faster systems to record data. Herman Hollerith, inspired by train conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details, invented the recording of data on a machine-readable punched card. Hollerith’s cards were used for the 1890 US Census, which finished months ahead of schedule and under budget. Later versions of tabulating machines had broad applications in business, such as financial accounting and data processing.

#### The word to remember across those twenty centuries is tabulate. Think of tabulation as “slicing and dicing” data to give it a structure, so that people can uncover patterns of useful information. You tabulate when you want to get a feel for what all those columns and rows of data in a table really mean.

#### Researchers call these centuries the Era of Tabulation, a time when machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets.

#### Machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets, that is, to reveal more insight than just simply counting to get a sum total

### The Era of Programming: Data analysis changed in the 1940s

#### During the turmoil of World War II, a new approach to dark data emerged: the Era of Programming. Scientists began building electronic computers, like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) at the University of Pennsylvania, that could run more than one kind of instruction (today we call those “programs”) in order to do more than one kind of calculation. ENIAC, for example, not only calculated artillery firing tables for the US Army, it worked in secret to study the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.

##### This was a huge breakthrough. Programmable computers guided astronauts from Earth to the moon and were reprogrammed during Apollo 13’s troubled mission to bring its astronauts safely back to Earth.

#### You’ve grown up during the Era of Programming. It even drives the phone you hold in your hand. But the dark data problem has also grown. Modern businesses and technology generate so much data that even the finest programmable supercomputer can't analyze it before the “heat-death” of the universe. Electronic computing is facing a crisis.

### The Era of AI: a brief history of AI

#### The history of artificial intelligence dates back to philosophers thinking about the question, "What more can be done with the world we live in?" This question lead to discussions and the very beginning of many ideas about the possibilities involving technology.

#### 1940s: Turing Machine

##### Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In the paper, Turing—famous for helping to break the Nazis’ Enigma code during World War II—proposes to answer the question "can machines think?" and introduces the Turing Test to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence (or the results of the same intelligence) as a human.

#### 1940s: Analogue Robots

#### 1950: Turing Test

#### 1951: Minsky Neural Net

#### 1956: Dartmouth Conference, Birth of AI

##### John McCarthy coins the term "artificial intelligence at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI software program. McCarthy would go on to invent the Lisp language.

##### The researchers proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” They called their vision “artificial intelligence” and they raised millions of dollars to achieve it within 20 years. During the next two decades, they accomplished tremendous things, creating machines that could prove geometry theorems, speak simple English, and even solve word problems with algebra.

#### 1957: Checkers

#### 1960s: Semantic Networks

#### 1966: ELIZA

#### 1969: SHRDLU Born

#### 1970-80: 1st AI Winter - K9, Star Wars
 
1st AI Winter caused byhigh expectations from end users andreduced funding.


###### Limited calculating power
Today, it is important for a computer to have enough processing power and memory. Every ad you see for companies like Apple or Dell emphasizes how fast their processors run and how much data they can work with. But in 1976, scientists realized that even the most successful computers of the day, working with natural language, could only manipulate a vocabulary of about 20 words. But a task like matching the performance of the human retina might require millions of instructions per second, at a time when the world’s fastest computer could run only about a hundred. By the early 1970s, it became clear that the problem was larger than researchers imagined. There were fundamental limits that no amount of money and effort could solve.

###### Limited information storage
Even simple, commonsense reasoning requires a lot of information to back it up. But no one in 1970 knew how to build a database large enough to hold even the information known by a 2-year-old child.

#### 1982: Expert Systems - ZX81

#### 1982: Hopfield Net/Back Propagation

#### 1982 to 1993: 2nd AI Winter - Joined IBM

##### 2nd AI Winter caused by unmet expectations and computing power.

##### Over 300 AI companies shut down or went bankrupt during The Second Winter of AI.

#### 1997: Deep Blue Beats Kasparov (chess)

#### 2005: DARPA Grand Challenge (self driving vehicle)

#### 2011: Watson Wins Jeopardy (quiz show)

##### IBM Watson beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at the US game show called Jeopardy!

#### 2016: AlphaGo (Go)

##### DeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves!). Google bought DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million in 2014.

#### 2017: Alpha Zero - K9 Mk 1

#### 2019: Project Debater

##### IBM unveils Project Debater, the first AI system capable of engaging with humans on complex topics in a live debate.

#### 2022: K9 Mk2

## 1.3 Module 3: Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Data

### About this Module

#### Data is raw information. Data might be facts, statistics, opinions, or any kind of content that is recorded in some format. This could include voices, photos, names, and even dance moves!

### A look at the types of Data

#### Structured Data

##### Structured data is typically categorized as quantitative data and is highly organized. Structured data is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Examples of structured data includes names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, stock information.

###### Sample: hotel and ticket reservation data

###### Sample: flight schedule

#### Unstructured Data (Dark Data)

##### Unstructured data, also known as dark data, is typically categorized as qualitative data. It cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics.

###### Sample: social media posts

###### Why would anyone want to search through a mountain of data such as social media posts?

* A sneaker designer looking for new trends

* Governments searching for possible terrorists

* Pandemic experts trying to anticipate disease outbreaks

* Financial institutions preparing for good times or a recession

##### The importance of unstructured data is rapidly increasing. Recent projections(opens in a new tab) indicate that 95% of businesses prioritize unstructured data management.
 
Experts estimate that about80% of all the data in today’s world is unstructured. It contains so many variables and changes so quickly that no conventional computer program can learn much from it.

 
Unstructured data is categorized asqualitative  data, and cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods


#### Semi-Structured Data

##### Semi-structured data is the “bridge” between structured and unstructured data. It doesn't have a predefined data model. It combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It's more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify specific data characteristics and scale data into records and preset fields. Metadata ultimately enables semi-structured data to be better cataloged, searched, and analyzed than unstructured data. An example of semi-structured data is a video on a social media site. The video by itself is unstructured data, but a video typically has text for the internet to easily categorize that information, such as through a hashtag to identify a location.

###### Sample: tweets organized by hashtags

##### Data that is not completely raw and contains elements such as tags and organizational metadata is known as semi-structured data

### Analyzing Unstructured Data

## 1.4 Module 4: Is Machine Learning the Answer to the Unstructured Data Problem?

### About this Module

Define and describe machine learning

Describe how machine learning structures unstructured data

Describe how machine learning uses probabilistic calculation to solve problems


### How does ML Approach a Problem?

#### Consider the problem of finding a route through big city traffic using a navigation system: ML Process's advantages

##### It doesn't need a DB of all the possible routes from one place to another. It just needs to know where places are on the map.

##### It can respond to traffic problems quickly because it doesn't need to store alternative routes for every possible traffic situation. It notes where slowdowns are and finds a way around them through trial and error.

##### It can work very quickly. While trying single turns one at a time, it can work through millions of tiny calculations.

#### Other ML's advantages that programmable computers lack

##### Machine learning can predict

##### Machine learning learns!

#### Machine Learning can analyze Dark Data (unstructured data) more quickly than a programmable computer can

### ML uses Probabilistic Calculation

#### Two other ways to contrast classical and machine learning systems

##### Deterministic

###### For a deterministic system, there must be an enormous, predetermined structure of routes—a gigantic database of possibilities from which the machine can make its choice. If a certain route leads to the destination, then the machine flags it as “YES”. If not, it flags it as “NO”. This is basically binary thinking: on or off, yes or no. This is the essence of a computer program. The answer is either true or false, not a confidence value.

##### Probabilistic

###### It never says “YES” or “NO”. Machine learning is analog (like waves gradually going up and down) rather than binary (like arrows pointing upward and downward). Machine learning constructs every possible route to a destination and compares them in real time, including all the variables such as changing traffic. So, a machine learning system doesn’t say, “This is the fastest route.” It says something like, “I am 84% confident that this route will get you there in the shortest time.” You might have seen this yourself if you’ve traveled in a car with an up-to-date GPS navigation system that offers you two or three choices with estimated times.

#### Machine learning enables a rich partnership between technology and humans

##### AI systems and humans excel at different things. For example, you, as a person, might excel at imagining possibilities, while AI excels at pinpointing patterns.

##### AI Capabilities

###### Pattern Identification

###### Machine Learning

###### Structuring information

###### Endless memory capacity

##### Human capabilities

###### Abstraction

###### Compassion

###### Generalization

###### Dreaming

#### Does Common Sense make sense?

##### Common sense draws on many complex generalizations mixed with compassion and abstractions. At this time, only humans can use common sense well. The problem is that common sense is often tainted with bias that can distort your judgment. AI systems can balance this. As long as AI systems are provided and trained with unbiased data, they can make recommendations that are free of bias. A partnership between humans and machines can lead to sensible decisions.

## 1.5 Module 5: Three Common Methods of Machine Learning

### About this Module

Describe three methods by which machine learning analyzes data


### Supervised Learning

#### is about providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions

#### All Supervised Learning algorithms need labeled data.

##### Labeled data is data that is grouped into samples that are tagged with one or more labels.
 
In other words, applying supervised learning requires you to tell your model:

1. What the key characteristics of a thing are, also calledfeatures

2. What the thing actually is


#### Example: Classification Problem

##### For example, the information might be drawings and photos of animals, some of which are dogs and are labeled “dog”. The machine will learn by identifying a pattern for “dog”. When the machine sees a new dog photo and is asked, “What is this?”, it will respond, “dog”, with high accuracy. This is known as a classification problem.

### Unsupervised Learning

#### A person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.

##### For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them. When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.

#### Example: Clustering Information
 
Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific “wrong” or “right” outcome. Instead, the algorithm is givenunlabeled data.


##### Unsupervised learning is helpful when you don't know how to classify data. For example, imagine you work for a banking institution and you have a large set of customer financial data. You don't know what type of groups or categories to organize the data. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm could find natural groupings of similar customers in a database, and then you could describe and label them.
 
This type of learning has the ability to discoversimilarities  anddifferences in information, which makes it an ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.


### Reinforcement Learning

#### A machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn't trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error.

##### A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem.

##### The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the "right" behavior and punishing the "wrong" behavior

##### Rewording a machine means that you give your agent positive reinforcement for performing the "right" thing and negative reinforcement for performing the "wrong" thing

#### Example: Trial and Error

#### As a machine learns through trial and error, it tries a prediction, then compares it with data in its corpus.

##### Each time the comparison is positive, the machine receives positive numerical feedback, or a reward.

##### Each time the comparison is negative, the machine receives negative numerical feedback, or a penalty.

#### Over time, a machine’s predictions will grow to be more accurate. It accomplishes this automatically based on feedback, rather than through human intervention.

## 1.6 Module 6: How will Machine Learning Transform Human Life?

### About this Module

Describe an ideal relationship between humans and machine learning


### Take another look at the Three Levels of AI

#### AI researcher Nick Bostrom defines this superintelligence as, “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” You’re likely to see General AI appear in your lifetime. General AI will enable supersmart bots and technologies to link AI with the Internet of Things through “embodied cognition”. This will give machines the ability to interact in human-like ways as they work alongside humans.

### What will interacting with general AI feel like to humans?

#### AI everywhere

##### AI will move into all industries, from finance, to education, to healthcare. AI will increase productivity and enable new opportunities.

#### Deeper insights

##### New technologies will sense, analyze, and understand things never before possible.

#### Engagement reimagined

##### New forms of human-machine interaction and emerging technologies, such as conversational bots, will transform how humans engage with each other and with machines.

#### Personalization

##### Machine interactions will be personalized for you, with new levels of detail and scale.

#### Instrumented planet

##### Billions of sensors generating exabytes of data will open new possibilities for improving Earth’s safety, sustainability, and security.

### What’s beyond these wonders? Humans, devices, and robots might exist as a collective “digital brain” that anticipates human needs, makes predictions, and provides solutions. Farther in the future, we might trust the digital brain to do things on our behalf across a broad spectrum of endeavors!

### “How does machine learning enable decision-making in complex scenarios, such as medical treatment choices?”

#### By providing probabilistic statements with confidence levels for different treatment options

## M1: The Debater Project

### A system that helps machines understand cultural knowledge, grammatical structures, and various language nuances is known as natural language processing

#### IBM Project Debater was a major step forward in the field of natural language processing.

#### Human language is complex, so machines require natural language processing systems to understand human language.

### Project Debater

#### IBM began developing Project Debater in 2012, hoping to build a machine that could do more than win debates with humans. In other words, IBM Project Debater would need to be able to do more than just answer questions in a human language; it would need to have the ability to listen to a series of competitive arguments posed by humans and respond to them intelligently. IBM's ultimate goal was to build a system that could help people make evidence-based, bias-free decisions on difficult topics where the answers aren’t obvious.

### Debate Steps

#### 1. Learn and Understand the Topic
 
Ingest several billion passages from newspapers, books, and journals. (AI researchers call this collection of learned material acorpus.语料库) Then, structure all that content so you can relate concepts to each other and evaluate them, even when they’re stated in different ways.


#### 2. Build a Position

##### Create an opening speech made of short pieces of text pasted together from the corpus. Your speech should detail your position on the debate topic. It can’t be a jumble of phrases. It must present a compelling argument, in logical order, using good grammar.

#### 3. Organize your Proof

##### Learn the deeper meaning of the facts that surround your topic. Decide what evidence is strongest and arrange your proof by themes. Adjust your arrangement each time new evidence arrives. This will help you find updated or completely new information that can score points against your opponent’s position.

#### 4. Respond to Your Opponent

##### Listen to your opponent’s arguments and rebuttals, then deliver a convincing rebuttal that refutes your opponent and further proves your case.

### Why do we care about these four steps? Because they reflect and test four things that cognitive systems do

#### Understanding

##### Cognitive systems understand like humans do

#### Reasoning

##### They reason underlying ideas and concepts.
They debate.
They infer and extract concepts.

他们推理潜在的思想和概念。

他们辩论。

他们推断并提取概念。


#### Learning

##### They never stop learning.
Advancing with each new piece of information, interaction, and outcome.
They develop "expertise".

#### Interacting

##### ... Allowing them to interact with humans.

### Steps in NLP

#### Understanding human language is difficult, even for people who have grown up with it. Human language is incredibly complex, full of strange expressions that seem to contradict each other, metaphors that require cultural knowledge to understand, and grammatical structures that sometimes turn simple ideas into tongue-twisters.

理解人类语言并非易事，即使对从小就接触人类语言的人来说也是如此。人类语言极其复杂，充满了看似自相矛盾的奇特表达、需要文化知识才能理解的隐喻，以及有时会将简单的想法变成绕口令的语法结构。


#### Machines require systems that research scientists call natural language processing, or NLP, to understand human language. IBM Project Debater was the most complex AI system IBM Research had ever built to understand human language.

## M2: AI Performs NLP

### NPL Sentence Segmentation and Tokens

#### In NLP, machines segment sentences and extract meaning from “tokens” of human language

#### Human language is unstructured. Although it is loosely held together by rules of grammar, our language expresses information in many confusing ways. Unlike structured information, which can be arranged in tables or matrices with neatly labeled rows and columns, unstructured information is messy and difficult to understand. To see why, consider this famous joke by Groucho Marx.
 
To deal with the “messiness” of unstructured information, computers begin with one sentence at a time. This is calledsentence segmentation. Computers then break the information into small chunks of information, calledtokens, that can be individually classified. Once the tokens in text have been sorted into a structure based on what they mean, NLP can work with them.


为了处理非结构化信息的“混乱”，计算机会从逐句开始处理。这被称为句子分割。然后，计算机将信息分解成小块信息，这些小块被称为“标记”，可以单独进行分类。一旦文本中的标记根据其含义被分类成结构，NLP 就可以对其进行处理。


#### "One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don’t know.

Adapted from Groucho Marx, 20th century comedian and movie star

##### Activity 1: Entities

###### An entity is a noun representing a person, place, or thing. It’s not an adjective, verb, or other article of speech.

###### I, elephant, and pajamas are entities because they are nouns.
Shot, an, in, and my are not entities because they are not nouns.

##### Activity 2: Relationships

###### A relationship is a group of two or more entities that have a strong connection to one another.

###### For I + elephant, I + pajamas, and elephant + pajamas, both words in the pair are nouns and are related entities.

I + shot is not a relationship between entities. I is a noun but shot is a not.

in + pajamas is not a relationship between entities. Pajamas is a noun but in is not.

###### Once an AI has classified entities and relationships in text or speech, the AI can begin structuring the information as a step toward understanding it. Your brain, by the way, does the same thing, which might have helped you find entities and relationships in the previous activities.

###### For example, consider the following two sentences: “Armen broke the glass. He always breaks the glass.” Notice that there is a relationship between the two sentences: the word he is related to the word Armen. The machine uses NLP to identify this relationship.

##### Activity 3: Concepts

###### A concept is something implied in a sentence but not actually stated. This is trickier because it involves matching ideas rather than the specific words present in the sentence.

### Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis

#### Emotion detection identifies distinct human emotion types.

情绪检测可以识别人类不同的情绪类型。


##### For example, you can determine if the emotion being expressed is anger, happiness, or fear after reading a user's rating and comments in an online customer satisfaction survey.

##### AI can be trained to classify emotions. Identifying the right emotional token can make a big difference when an AI system is reading a social media post or a customer service chat, in which different emotions significantly change the meaning of a sentence.

#### Sentiment analysis isn’t a specific emotion —at least, not as computer scientists use the term. Instead, it’s a measure of the strength of an emotion.

情绪分析并非指代某种特定的情绪——至少，计算机科学家不是这么称呼它的。相反，它是对情绪强度的衡量。


##### You can think of sentiment as a sliding scale between positive and negative, with neutral in the middle.

##### Sentiment analysis is a means of assessing if data is positive, negative, or neutral.

##### Sentiment Analysis is A method to measure the strength of an emotion by assessing data as positive, negative, or neutral

### The Classification Problem

#### Human Language makes classification challenging --
Human language is full of terms that are vague or have double meanings. This is called a classification problem. In the riddle, run and smell each have two meanings.

##### "A runny nose" means you have a cold and you need a tissue to wipe your nose.

##### "A smelly foot" means that your  foot has an unpleasant odor.
 
Classification can be more difficult for an AI system than identifying tokens because so much of classification depends on the context in which a sentence is contained.


##### Compare I went to the docks to ship my box to I went to the station to ship my box. Both sentences indicate where a box’s travel begins, but neither specifies how it will travel. An AI system must associate the word ship with either the word station or docks, and then relate that association with the right concept: either train or boat.

##### How does an AI system deal with this problem? After ingesting several thousand instances in which shipping from a dock results in boat travel, while shipping from a station leads to shipping by rail, the AI system identifies the frequency in which places and kinds of travel are linked. Gradually, the system gets better at classification and makes fewer mistakes. However, as with humans, an AI system’s classification will never be 100% perfect. (That’s why well-designed AI systems give not only a response, but also a confidence value.)

#### As you’ve learned, getting from tokens and classification to answering questions (or winning a debate) is a complex endeavor. But it isn’t enough to take a machine all the way to understanding. You will learn about ways to do this later in this course.

## M3: Chatbots use NLP to Interact with Humans

### About this Module

#### Describe how a chatbot understands, reasons, learns, and interacts with users

#### Distinguish between intents, entities, and dialogs

#### Identify appropriate uses for chatbots

#### Identify real-world uses for natural language processing

### Chatbot Structure

#### Chatbots work with small data. This means their scale is much more limited.

#### A Chatbot has a "frontend" and a "backend"

##### The frontend of a chatbot is the messaging channel. The frontend interacts with the person who’s asking questions, both listening (or reading) and speaking (or presenting text).

###### User Interaction

##### The backend of a chatbot is where the hard work takes place. The backend operates application logic and has enough memory to remember earlier parts of a conversation as dialog continues.
 (see:)
###### Logic

###### Data

### The Chatbot Backend
 
A chatbot’s backend does the hard work ofunderstanding  andresponding

 
This is a great job for algorithms calledclassifiers.


##### Classifiers can map many different ways of asking a question to a very small set of answers. How small? Some retail chatbots respond to hundreds of different questions with only five or six possible answers. Questions the chatbots can’t answer are sent to human customer service representatives.

#### Chatbots are designed for a small set of interaction types.

### Intents, Entities, and Dialog

#### A ChatBot backend usually includes 3 parts: intents, entities, and dialog
 
Chatbots understand a question by breaking it into parts and relating those parts to things in its memory. A chatbot’s goal is to identify what are calledentities andintents, then use what it’s found to trigger adialog. What do these terms mean?


##### The chatbot breaks inputs apart to identify intents and entities.

#### Intent

##### An intent is a purpose: the reason why a user is contacting the chatbot. Think of it as something like a verb: a kind of action. A user might intend to file a complaint, to ask for directions, to speak to a salesperson.

###### A chatbot runs NLP to understand the human’s intentions of their typed input.

#### Entity
 
An entity is anoun: a person, place, or thing. This concept was covered earlier in this course.


#### Dialog

##### A dialog is a flowchart—an IF / THEN tree structure that illustrates how a machine will respond to user intents. A dialog is what the machine replies after a human asks a question. Even if a human uses run-on sentences, poor grammar, chat messaging expressions, and so on, artificial intelligence allows the NLP to understand well enough to provide a response.

###### The dialog represents each possible word or phrase a user might enter, the matched response for the chatbot, and the many possible subsequent replies a user might make next.
 
That’s too much for an ordinary flowchart to show (you might need three or four dimensions!), so chatbot software condenses each moment of the conversation into anode.


###### A node contains a statement by the chatbot and a long, expandable list of possible replies.
 
A dialog is represented by aflowchart that illustrates how a chatbot will respond after a human asks a question.


### Example NLP Analysis

#### Intents, entities, and dialogs make quick work for NLP

#### In a conventional computer, the program code is stupendously large but wouldn’t handle intents, entities, and dialogs very well. A conventional computer would need a separate IF / THEN line for many thousands of ways a question might be asked. Unless a human were to match one of those lines perfectly, the computer would fail.

#### But an AI system’s combination of NLP with intents, entities, and dialog can make quick work of this. NLP analyzes sentence components, then uses processes like passage and evidence scoring to classify the sentence components against possible chatbot responses. The result is that when a human user asks a question, the AI system provides the answer with the highest confidence.

但人工智能系统将自然语言处理 (NLP) 与意图、实体和对话相结合，可以快速完成这项工作。NLP 会分析句子成分，然后使用段落和证据评分等流程，根据聊天机器人的可能响应对句子成分进行分类。这样，当人类用户提出问题时，人工智能系统就能提供置信度最高的答案。


## M4: AI Classifies Images

### About this Module

#### Describe how AI classifies images to derive meaning from them
 
Describe how aconvolutional neural network (CNN) analyzes an image


描述卷积神经网络 (CNN) 如何分析图像

 
Describe how agenerative adversarial network  (GAN) creates a credible image


描述生成对抗网络 (GAN) 如何创建可信图像


#### Identify real-world uses for computer vision

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

#### An AI system uses a convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze images

##### It's one thing to display an image and another, much more complicated thing to analyze it.
 
The process - called aconvolutional neural network (CNN) - makes it possible for visual recognition systems to identify things in an image, as in facial recognition.


#### In a CNN, two small groups of pixels that overlap each other are compared mathematically to get a value. AI can use thousands of these small comparisons to identify individual parts of an image, then compare them to images in its corpus. From this, AI can put together an overall identification, without being overwhelmed.

#### CNN process makes facial recognition possible

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

#### A visual recognition system can use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create new drawings and photos

#### One way is by pitting two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against each other in a “contest” called a generative adversarial network, or GAN. In effect, the CNNs battle each other until one of them becomes pretty good at creating art.

#### A GAN battle ends with an image that’s ready to be shown to a human. Sometimes, the human might laugh and think the resulting image is ridiculous. But other times, the human, like the CNN acting as judge and teacher, won’t be able to tell the difference. At that point, the deep fake is a success!

### Computer Vision Applications

#### The IBM Maximo visual inspection system can be equipped with video cameras on drones. It can not only detect problems, like cracks in a suspension bridge, but identify which problems (cracks, in this example) are dangerous and should be repaired.

#### Here are more applications

##### Spotting a dangerous but difficult-to-detect flaw in an airplane’s wing

##### Monitoring water flow across a dairy farm to ensure it doesn’t reach nearby food crops

##### Counting the number of people in an unruly crowd

##### Classifying animal and plant populations to measure biodiversity in a forest

##### Performing lip-reading for people who cannot hear or speak

##### Inspecting robots at work on an assembly line

Machine learning can enable systems topredictandclassifygiven data in response to ever-changing data, somewhat like the way you learn from experience.

 
Deep learningis a group of extremely powerful types of machine learning, many of which are inspired by the operation ofneural networksin the human brain

 
These AI systems do not have common sense or world knowledge, nor do they have a sense of self (at least, not yet). But they do acquire knowledge and understanding through experience—a process calledcognition—accomplishing results that resemble human thinking. They do this primarily by using complex rules calledalgorithms that help them analyze data.


## M1 How do Machines Learn?

Learning objectives



After completing this module, you should be able to:



- Distinguish between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning
- Describe supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning


### About this Module

### Machines learn in 3 general ways

#### AI systems use algorithms to predict and classify data points collected both from computer databases and natural occurrences. But algorithms have three general ways that they can learn from this data to get better results and provide better predictions:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning
 
In supervised learning, humans give an AI system what’s called structured data. This is a set of facts and figures arranged into neat,labeled  categories, the way you might put weather information into a table.


#### Using the way the data has been structured, the AI system can detect patterns (such as day-to-day temperature changes in the table above) and use those patterns to predict future data (such as temperatures during the following week).

#### Structured data can also take the form of images.

##### If, for example, the data includes photos of flowers, some of which are roses and are labeled rose, the machine will learn things about the arrangements of pixels in those photos. Later, when it sees a new rose photo and is asked, “What is this?”, it will respond “rose”.

#### As you’ll soon discover, the machine will never give this result with absolute confidence. Instead, the system will give a confidence value to indicate, for example, that it might predict with 85% certainty that its answer is correct. The more data the system ingests, the higher its accuracy will be.

#### Example

##### An AI system ingests data that has been labeled

##### Supervised learning requires that an AI system ingest structured data.

##### Maria is involved in training the AI for her company. She separates weather data in a database into different categories.

### Unsupervised Learning

#### It has often been convenient to refer to plants or their behavior in terms implying reasoning faculties. Of course, plants are never reasoning things, reasonable as many of their actions appear to be, and to ascribe such qualities to them is to saddle them with attributes perfectly foreign to the plant world.

#### In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning trains a machine with unlabeled data, such as the text of a book. Training an AI system with unlabeled data is more difficult because the system can’t make predictions until it has structured the data itself. In the book example, structuring the data would involve breaking down the text and finding relationships between words and sentences. So, algorithms explore the data and try to find structure.

##### For example, a system might be fed many articles about different kinds of plants and form its own conclusions of their attributes. When the system ingests new text describing a plant, it identifies it and gives it a confidence value.

#### Example

##### An AI system ingests data that is not labeled

##### Unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning require a system to develop its own structure either by analyzing large amounts of data (unsupervised learning) or by trial-and-error (reinforcement learning).

##### Katie has a huge amount of warehouse data to sort but doesn’t know how to categorize it.

### Reinforcement Learning

#### With reinforcement learning, a machine is not given specific information to ingest. Instead, it learns through trial and error. The machine’s algorithms are rewarded when it performs a correct action and penalized when it doesn’t.

##### Suppose this system is given a photo that probably depicts a dog, and it’s asked, “Is this a dog?” Remember, it has been fed little or no structured information about dogs.

##### The machine answers YES or NO, and gives itself a confidence value that is somewhere between 100% correct and 100Reinforcement learning% incorrect.

##### Then it is given new information indicating whether that answer really was right or wrong. This is where the reinforcement takes place.

###### For each answer that’s largely wrong, the machine is penalized: its algorithms are adjusted and the picture is sent back for another try.

###### But for each answer that’s largely correct, the algorithms are rewarded.

##### After these penalties and rewards happen many times, the machine’s answers become more accurate and its confidence value grows higher.

#### This is particularly useful when a machine needs to work on a specific type of problem. The machine continuously make decisions until it reaches a long-term goal. Each decision the machine makes is based on the previous decision. This is common in an area like game-playing, where a series of moves can win or lose a game.

#### Example

##### An AI system learns by trial and error

##### Unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning require a system to develop its own structure either by analyzing large amounts of data (unsupervised learning) or by trial-and-error (reinforcement learning).

##### Pedro is working with a chess-playing AI system. He rewards it when it wins and penalizes it when it loses.

##### Aditi is training an AI system in which it is penalized for answers that are largely wrong and rewarded for answers that are largely correct.

### How do Machines Learn?
 
two different technologies by which machine learning takes place:classical machine learning and members of a group of technologies called thedeep learning ecosystem.


## M2 Classical Machine Learning

### About this Module

Learning objectives



After completing this module, you should be able to:



- Describe decision trees, linear regression, and logistic regression
- List and explain advantages of classical machine learning
- Describe and explain how a sigmoid function is used in machine learning


### Classical Machine Learning

#### Classical machine learning began in the 1950s. AI systems learned by ingesting data and getting better at recognizing patterns. The AI systems could predict things like the distance between points or the intensity of values.
 
Like all machine learning, the classical form depends onalgorithms


##### Classical machine learning uses a small number of algorithms in a relatively simple arrangement.

##### Sometimes machine learning algorithms are binary, which means that they output one of only two values. Typical binary results might be a 1 or a 0, a YES or a NO, and a TRUE or a FALSE.

##### Other classical learning algorithms are more complicated. For example, their result might be represented as a position on a multidimensional graph rather than “this point” or “that point”. Here are three typical algorithms that are used in classical computing:

###### Decision tree

###### Linear regression

###### Logistic regression

### Decision Tree
 
Adecision tree is asupervised learning algorithm. It operates like a flowchart. You can think of a flowchart as an upside-down decision tree. The flowchart has aroot node (where the flowchart begins), branches that connect tointernal nodes, and more branches that connect toleaf nodes.


#### Example

##### What major should I take, based on professor's names and my level or interest?

###### Deciding a major would use a decision tree based on professors' names and personal interest.

### Linear Regression

#### Linear regression is another type of algorithm. It relates to data that might be graphed as a straight line.

##### For example, a business might believe that more advertising spending leads to better sales. This could be graphed as a series of dots that form a rising straight line, as depicted here.

#### Without adjustment, resulting graph is too general to help a business make a good decision. That’s where linear regression can help. Linear regression can learn all the variables, then calculate a reasonably accurate prediction of how advertising will impact sales at some time and location in the future. In effect, linear regression resolves the mass of dots into a “most likely” line that can be used for simple prediction.

#### A linear regression answers a question such as “If this increases by X, how much will Y increase?”

#### Example

##### How do advanced placement (AP) classes passed related to college acceptances?

###### More AP classes passed leading to more college acceptances would use linear regression.

##### What type of algorithm would help you ﬁnd out what you might earn for a salary if you have different levels of college degrees in computer science?

##### You’ve been asked to create a machine learning service that helps people choose what concert to attend on a particular date based on the type of music they prefer, who is singing, and where the event is taking place.

### Logistic Regression

#### In some situations, a relationship does not fall in a straight line. Sometimes a system uses values that require a specific, limited kind of outcome, such as something between 0 and 1 (or NO and YES).

#### In this situation, a graph can form what’s called a sigmoid function, or an S-shaped curve, as shown in the accompanying example. For any set of variables, the outcome (which is a point on the S-curve) falls between 0 and 1.

在这种情况下，图形可以形成所谓的 S 型函数，或称 S 形曲线，如示例所示。对于任何一组变量，结果（即 S 曲线上的一个点）都在 0 到 1 之间。


#### A logistic regression answers a question such as “If this increases by X, will the value of Y be closer to 0 or 1?”

#### Only logistic regressions have outputs between 0 and 1

#### Example

##### How do hours spent studying related to passing an exam?

###### An exam passed or failed is binary (YES or NO) so relating it to hours studied would use logistic regression.

##### You want to know how many hours to study to pass an exam. The “hours of studying” data forms a sigmoid function, or an S-shaped curve, between “fail” and “pass”.

### Classical ML is Not Obsolete

#### Classical machine learning can be outperformed, at some tasks, by newer methods that are part of the deep learning ecosystem.

#### But there are still reasons to use classical machine learning. These include:

##### Work with structured data

###### Classical machine learning is used mostly with structured data from databases, such as hours studied compared to grades earned.

##### Lower expense to operate

###### Classical machine learning requires less computing power than deep learning ecosystems. They can run on less expensive computers with less powerful processors, which lowers the price for smaller businesses, communities, or healthcare systems that share time on them in pay-as-you-go arrangements.

##### Easier to interpret

###### Deep networks are so complex that even AI researchers don’t entirely understand what’s going on inside. As a result, AI researchers are not always able to determine when deep network systems are producing invalid outputs. Compared to these mysteries, classical results can be easier to debug, and to test for accuracy and lack of bias.
