## 1.1 Module 1: What is AI?

### About this Module

#### Three levels of predictions that AI can make

##### Narrow

##### Broad

##### General

### What is AI?
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine tolearn patterns andmake predictions.


#### AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI add values to human judgment.
 
AI is a field that combinescomputer science  and robustdataset to enable problem-solving.


### What is the difference between AI and Augmented Intelligence?

#### Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do.

##### Augmented intelligence allows humans to make final decisions after analyzing data, reports, and other types of data

##### Augmented intelligence acts on behalf of people in the physical world in a way that complements human abilities

#### Artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.

##### AI performs tasks without human intervention and completes mundane and repetitive tasks for humans

#### AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

#### Machines vs. Humans

##### Machines

###### Ingesting Large Amount of Data

###### Repetitive Tasks

###### Accurate

##### Humans

###### Generalizing Information

###### Creativity

###### Emotional Intelligence

### What does AI do?

#### Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them "AI Services") don't think. They calculate.

##### They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history.
 
Some can perform what's calledmachine learning  as they acquire new data.

 
Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even performdeep learning  with multiple levels of calculations.


#### Two parts of AI Services Calculate

##### Analysis

###### AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.

##### Prediction

###### AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”
 
AI Services based on dataanalysis, makeprediction.


### What Predictions can AI Make?

#### Prediction aren't always accurate. But if they're correct often enough, they're useful and can save your time.

#### More ways that AI uses data to make predictions

##### Human Language

###### Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.

##### Vision Recognition

###### AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.

##### Fraud Detection

###### AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.

### How is AI Evolving?

#### Narrow AI (2010-2015)

##### Narrow AI si focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day

##### Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. e.g., you can buy a book with a voice-based device.

##### Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.

#### Broad AI (AI for Enterprise) (Today), We are here

##### Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and Genaral AI

##### Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks

##### Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system

##### New Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends

#### General AI (2050 and beyond)

##### General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can

##### Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.

#### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) (near the end of this century)

##### Machine might become self-aware!

## 1.2 Module 2: What are the three eras of computing?

### About this Module

#### Describe the history of AI, from the past to the possible future

### The Era of Tabulation: People have analyzed data for centuries

#### Dark Data

##### Dark Data: it's information without structure, just a huge, unsorted mess of facts.

#### Unstructured Data

##### Over 2000 years ago, tax collectors for Emperor Qin Shihuang used the abacus—a device with beads on wires—to break down tax receipts and arrange them into categories. From this, they could determine how much the Emperor should spend on building extensions to the Great Wall of China.

##### In England during the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace designed (but never finished) what they called a “difference engine” designed to handle complex calculations using logarithms and trigonometry. Had they built it, the difference engine might have helped the English Navy build tables of ocean tides and depth soundings that could guide English sailors through rough waters.

##### By the late 1880s, people were thinking about how to develop faster systems to record data. Herman Hollerith, inspired by train conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details, invented the recording of data on a machine-readable punched card. Hollerith’s cards were used for the 1890 US Census, which finished months ahead of schedule and under budget. Later versions of tabulating machines had broad applications in business, such as financial accounting and data processing.

#### The word to remember across those twenty centuries is tabulate. Think of tabulation as “slicing and dicing” data to give it a structure, so that people can uncover patterns of useful information. You tabulate when you want to get a feel for what all those columns and rows of data in a table really mean.

#### Researchers call these centuries the Era of Tabulation, a time when machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets.

#### Machines helped humans sort data into structures to reveal its secrets, that is, to reveal more insight than just simply counting to get a sum total

### The Era of Programming: Data analysis changed in the 1940s

#### During the turmoil of World War II, a new approach to dark data emerged: the Era of Programming. Scientists began building electronic computers, like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) at the University of Pennsylvania, that could run more than one kind of instruction (today we call those “programs”) in order to do more than one kind of calculation. ENIAC, for example, not only calculated artillery firing tables for the US Army, it worked in secret to study the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.

##### This was a huge breakthrough. Programmable computers guided astronauts from Earth to the moon and were reprogrammed during Apollo 13’s troubled mission to bring its astronauts safely back to Earth.

#### You’ve grown up during the Era of Programming. It even drives the phone you hold in your hand. But the dark data problem has also grown. Modern businesses and technology generate so much data that even the finest programmable supercomputer can't analyze it before the “heat-death” of the universe. Electronic computing is facing a crisis.

### The Era of AI: a brief history of AI

#### The history of artificial intelligence dates back to philosophers thinking about the question, "What more can be done with the world we live in?" This question lead to discussions and the very beginning of many ideas about the possibilities involving technology.

#### 1940s: Turing Machine

##### Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In the paper, Turing—famous for helping to break the Nazis’ Enigma code during World War II—proposes to answer the question "can machines think?" and introduces the Turing Test to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence (or the results of the same intelligence) as a human.

#### 1940s: Analogue Robots

#### 1950: Turing Test

#### 1951: Minsky Neural Net

#### 1956: Dartmouth Conference, Birth of AI

##### John McCarthy coins the term "artificial intelligence at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI software program. McCarthy would go on to invent the Lisp language.

##### The researchers proposed that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” They called their vision “artificial intelligence” and they raised millions of dollars to achieve it within 20 years. During the next two decades, they accomplished tremendous things, creating machines that could prove geometry theorems, speak simple English, and even solve word problems with algebra.

#### 1957: Checkers

#### 1960s: Semantic Networks

#### 1966: ELIZA

#### 1969: SHRDLU Born

#### 1970-80: 1st AI Winter - K9, Star Wars
 
1st AI Winter caused byhigh expectations from end users andreduced funding.


###### Limited calculating power
Today, it is important for a computer to have enough processing power and memory. Every ad you see for companies like Apple or Dell emphasizes how fast their processors run and how much data they can work with. But in 1976, scientists realized that even the most successful computers of the day, working with natural language, could only manipulate a vocabulary of about 20 words. But a task like matching the performance of the human retina might require millions of instructions per second, at a time when the world’s fastest computer could run only about a hundred. By the early 1970s, it became clear that the problem was larger than researchers imagined. There were fundamental limits that no amount of money and effort could solve.

###### Limited information storage
Even simple, commonsense reasoning requires a lot of information to back it up. But no one in 1970 knew how to build a database large enough to hold even the information known by a 2-year-old child.

#### 1982: Expert Systems - ZX81

#### 1982: Hopfield Net/Back Propagation

#### 1982 to 1993: 2nd AI Winter - Joined IBM

##### 2nd AI Winter caused by unmet expectations and computing power.

##### Over 300 AI companies shut down or went bankrupt during The Second Winter of AI.

#### 1997: Deep Blue Beats Kasparov (chess)

#### 2005: DARPA Grand Challenge (self driving vehicle)

#### 2011: Watson Wins Jeopardy (quiz show)

##### IBM Watson beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at the US game show called Jeopardy!

#### 2016: AlphaGo (Go)

##### DeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves!). Google bought DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million in 2014.

#### 2017: Alpha Zero - K9 Mk 1

#### 2019: Project Debater

##### IBM unveils Project Debater, the first AI system capable of engaging with humans on complex topics in a live debate.

#### 2022: K9 Mk2

## 1.3 Module 3: Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Data

### About this Module

#### Data is raw information. Data might be facts, statistics, opinions, or any kind of content that is recorded in some format. This could include voices, photos, names, and even dance moves!

### A look at the types of Data

#### Structured Data

##### Structured data is typically categorized as quantitative data and is highly organized. Structured data is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Examples of structured data includes names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, stock information.

###### Sample: hotel and ticket reservation data

###### Sample: flight schedule

#### Unstructured Data (Dark Data)

##### Unstructured data, also known as dark data, is typically categorized as qualitative data. It cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics.

###### Sample: social media posts

###### Why would anyone want to search through a mountain of data such as social media posts?

* A sneaker designer looking for new trends

* Governments searching for possible terrorists

* Pandemic experts trying to anticipate disease outbreaks

* Financial institutions preparing for good times or a recession

##### The importance of unstructured data is rapidly increasing. Recent projections(opens in a new tab) indicate that 95% of businesses prioritize unstructured data management.
 
Experts estimate that about80% of all the data in today’s world is unstructured. It contains so many variables and changes so quickly that no conventional computer program can learn much from it.

 
Unstructured data is categorized asqualitative  data, and cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods


#### Semi-Structured Data

##### Semi-structured data is the “bridge” between structured and unstructured data. It doesn't have a predefined data model. It combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It's more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify specific data characteristics and scale data into records and preset fields. Metadata ultimately enables semi-structured data to be better cataloged, searched, and analyzed than unstructured data. An example of semi-structured data is a video on a social media site. The video by itself is unstructured data, but a video typically has text for the internet to easily categorize that information, such as through a hashtag to identify a location.

###### Sample: tweets organized by hashtags

##### Data that is not completely raw and contains elements such as tags and organizational metadata is known as semi-structured data

### Analyzing Unstructured Data

## 1.4 Module 4: Is Machine Learning the Answer to the Unstructured Data Problem?

### About this Module

Define and describe machine learning

Describe how machine learning structures unstructured data

Describe how machine learning uses probabilistic calculation to solve problems


### How does ML Approach a Problem?

#### Consider the problem of finding a route through big city traffic using a navigation system: ML Process's advantages

##### It doesn't need a DB of all the possible routes from one place to another. It just needs to know where places are on the map.

##### It can respond to traffic problems quickly because it doesn't need to store alternative routes for every possible traffic situation. It notes where slowdowns are and finds a way around them through trial and error.

##### It can work very quickly. While trying single turns one at a time, it can work through millions of tiny calculations.

#### Other ML's advantages that programmable computers lack

##### Machine learning can predict

##### Machine learning learns!

#### Machine Learning can analyze Dark Data (unstructured data) more quickly than a programmable computer can

### ML uses Probabilistic Calculation

#### Two other ways to contrast classical and machine learning systems

##### Deterministic

###### For a deterministic system, there must be an enormous, predetermined structure of routes—a gigantic database of possibilities from which the machine can make its choice. If a certain route leads to the destination, then the machine flags it as “YES”. If not, it flags it as “NO”. This is basically binary thinking: on or off, yes or no. This is the essence of a computer program. The answer is either true or false, not a confidence value.

##### Probabilistic

###### It never says “YES” or “NO”. Machine learning is analog (like waves gradually going up and down) rather than binary (like arrows pointing upward and downward). Machine learning constructs every possible route to a destination and compares them in real time, including all the variables such as changing traffic. So, a machine learning system doesn’t say, “This is the fastest route.” It says something like, “I am 84% confident that this route will get you there in the shortest time.” You might have seen this yourself if you’ve traveled in a car with an up-to-date GPS navigation system that offers you two or three choices with estimated times.

#### Machine learning enables a rich partnership between technology and humans

##### AI systems and humans excel at different things. For example, you, as a person, might excel at imagining possibilities, while AI excels at pinpointing patterns.

##### AI Capabilities

###### Pattern Identification

###### Machine Learning

###### Structuring information

###### Endless memory capacity

##### Human capabilities

###### Abstraction

###### Compassion

###### Generalization

###### Dreaming

#### Does Common Sense make sense?

##### Common sense draws on many complex generalizations mixed with compassion and abstractions. At this time, only humans can use common sense well. The problem is that common sense is often tainted with bias that can distort your judgment. AI systems can balance this. As long as AI systems are provided and trained with unbiased data, they can make recommendations that are free of bias. A partnership between humans and machines can lead to sensible decisions.

## 1.5 Module 5: Three Common Methods of Machine Learning

### About this Module

Describe three methods by which machine learning analyzes data


### Supervised Learning

#### is about providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions

#### All Supervised Learning algorithms need labeled data.

##### Labeled data is data that is grouped into samples that are tagged with one or more labels.
 
In other words, applying supervised learning requires you to tell your model:

1. What the key characteristics of a thing are, also calledfeatures

2. What the thing actually is


#### Example: Classification Problem

##### For example, the information might be drawings and photos of animals, some of which are dogs and are labeled “dog”. The machine will learn by identifying a pattern for “dog”. When the machine sees a new dog photo and is asked, “What is this?”, it will respond, “dog”, with high accuracy. This is known as a classification problem.

### Unsupervised Learning

#### A person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.

##### For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them. When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.

#### Example: Clustering Information
 
Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific “wrong” or “right” outcome. Instead, the algorithm is givenunlabeled data.


##### Unsupervised learning is helpful when you don't know how to classify data. For example, imagine you work for a banking institution and you have a large set of customer financial data. You don't know what type of groups or categories to organize the data. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm could find natural groupings of similar customers in a database, and then you could describe and label them.
 
This type of learning has the ability to discoversimilarities  anddifferences in information, which makes it an ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.


### Reinforcement Learning

#### A machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn't trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error.

##### A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem.

##### The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the "right" behavior and punishing the "wrong" behavior

##### Rewording a machine means that you give your agent positive reinforcement for performing the "right" thing and negative reinforcement for performing the "wrong" thing

#### Example: Trial and Error

#### As a machine learns through trial and error, it tries a prediction, then compares it with data in its corpus.

##### Each time the comparison is positive, the machine receives positive numerical feedback, or a reward.

##### Each time the comparison is negative, the machine receives negative numerical feedback, or a penalty.

#### Over time, a machine’s predictions will grow to be more accurate. It accomplishes this automatically based on feedback, rather than through human intervention.

## 1.6 Module 6: How will Machine Learning Transform Human Life?

### About this Module

Describe an ideal relationship between humans and machine learning


### Take another look at the Three Levels of AI

#### AI researcher Nick Bostrom defines this superintelligence as, “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” You’re likely to see General AI appear in your lifetime. General AI will enable supersmart bots and technologies to link AI with the Internet of Things through “embodied cognition”. This will give machines the ability to interact in human-like ways as they work alongside humans.

### What will interacting with general AI feel like to humans?

#### AI everywhere

##### AI will move into all industries, from finance, to education, to healthcare. AI will increase productivity and enable new opportunities.

#### Deeper insights

##### New technologies will sense, analyze, and understand things never before possible.

#### Engagement reimagined

##### New forms of human-machine interaction and emerging technologies, such as conversational bots, will transform how humans engage with each other and with machines.

#### Personalization

##### Machine interactions will be personalized for you, with new levels of detail and scale.

#### Instrumented planet

##### Billions of sensors generating exabytes of data will open new possibilities for improving Earth’s safety, sustainability, and security.

### What’s beyond these wonders? Humans, devices, and robots might exist as a collective “digital brain” that anticipates human needs, makes predictions, and provides solutions. Farther in the future, we might trust the digital brain to do things on our behalf across a broad spectrum of endeavors!

### “How does machine learning enable decision-making in complex scenarios, such as medical treatment choices?”

#### By providing probabilistic statements with confidence levels for different treatment options
