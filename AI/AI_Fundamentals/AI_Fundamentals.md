## 1.1 Module 1: What is AI?

### About this Module

#### Three levels of predictions that AI can make

##### Narrow

##### Broad

##### General

### What is AI?
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine tolearn patterns andmake predictions.


#### AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI add values to human judgment.
 
AI is a field that combinescomputer science  and robustdataset to enable problem-solving.


### What is the difference between AI and Augmented Intelligence?

#### Augmented intelligence has a modest goal of helping humans with tasks that are not practical to do.

##### Augmented intelligence allows humans to make final decisions after analyzing data, reports, and other types of data

#### Artificial intelligence has a lofty goal of mimicking human thinking and processes.

##### AI performs tasks without human intervention and completes mundane and repetitive tasks for humans

#### AI today is not mature enough to perform independent tasks such as diagnosing cancer.

#### Machines vs. Humans

##### Machines

###### Ingesting Large Amount of Data

###### Repetitive Tasks

###### Accurate

##### Humans

###### Generalizing Information

###### Creativity

###### Emotional Intelligence

### What does AI do?

#### Artificial intelligence machines (researchers call them "AI Services") don't think. They calculate.

##### They represent some of the newest, most sophisticated calculating machines in human history.
 
Some can perform what's calledmachine learning  as they acquire new data.

 
Others, using calculations arranged in ways inspired by neurons in the human brain, can even performdeep learning  with multiple levels of calculations.


#### Two parts of AI Services Calculate

##### Analysis

###### AI services can take in (or “ingest”) enormous amounts of data. They can apply mathematical calculations to analyze data, sorting and organizing it in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago.

##### Prediction

###### AI services can use their data analysis to make predictions. They can, in effect, say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen.”
 
AI Services based on dataanalysis, makeprediction.


### What Predictions can AI Make?

#### Prediction aren't always accurate. But if they're correct often enough, they're useful and can save your time.

#### More ways that AI uses data to make predictions

##### Human Language

###### Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze poorly typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on topics ranging from shipping or business hours to merchandise and sizes.

##### Vision Recognition

###### AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early-warning signs, and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic.

##### Fraud Detection

###### AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft.

### How is AI Evolving?

#### Narrow AI (2010-2015)

##### Narrow AI si focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day

##### Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. e.g., you can buy a book with a voice-based device.

##### Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.

#### Broad AI (AI for Enterprise) (Today), We are here

##### Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and Genaral AI

##### Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks

##### Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system

##### New Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends

#### General AI (2050 and beyond)

##### General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can

##### Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.

#### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) (near the end of this century)

##### Machine might become self-aware!
