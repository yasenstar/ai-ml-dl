## Overview / Foreword

Machine Learning is not an overnight movement and the path to the present day has been anything but smooth sailing.

| # | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Conceptual theories emerged in the **1950s** but progress was stalled by computational constraints and limited data. |
| 2 | This resulted in a logjam (堵塞) of research and good intentions as theoretical models of prediction, algorithm design, and extrapolation of future possibilities accumulated in research institutions until powerfull processing chips and large datasets emerged in the **1990s** |
| 3 | Renewed interest helped to breach the gap between theory and capability during **this decade** but it still wasn't enough to push field-altering breakthroughs in the space of deep learning. |
| 4 | That breakthrough came in **2009** when Adjunct Professor Andrew Ng and his team at Stanford University experimented with tethering gaming chips - better known for imaging rendering - to solve complect data problems. |
| 5 | In **2016**, media interest climbed to a new high at the glitzy (闪亮的) Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, where TV cameras locked lenses on an 18-by-18 Go board with the world champion on one side and an AI program on the other. |
| 6 | Contrary to these initial headlines, the **2017** Netflix documentary *AlphaGo* helped to later realign attention towards the human ingenuity behind AlphaGo's victory. |
| 7 | Despite its prolific (丰富的) success, the AlphaGo program has not replaced any of the programmers who worked on its source code or taken away their salaries. In fact, the development of AlphaGo has helped to expand the sixe and profile of the company DeepMind Technologies, which was acquired by Alphabet Inc earlier in **2014**. |

The ideal skillset for a machine learning developer spans **coding, data management, and knowledge of statistics and mathematics**. Optional areas of expertise include **data visualization, big data management, and practical experience in distributed computing architecture**.

The content of this tutorial is designed for beginners with general knowledge of machine learning, including common algorithms e.g. logistic regression and decision trees.
