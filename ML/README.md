| Deinition | Supervised learning is akin to learning with a teacher. In this paradigm, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the output for new, unseen inputs. | The Reinforcement learning (RL) is an interactive type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by the interacting with its environment. The agent takes actions and receives rewards or penalties based on its performance with the aim of maximizing the cumulative rewards over time. | The Unsupervised learning deals with the data that has no labeled outcomes. The model is tasked with the identifying patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset. Since there are no labels, the model doesn’t receive direct feedback or guidance on what the correct output should be. |
| Key Characteristics |  | - **Interaction with Environment**: The agent learns by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward overtime.<br>- **No Labeled Data Required**: |  |
